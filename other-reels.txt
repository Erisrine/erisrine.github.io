SOUND DESIGN YOU CAN FEEL
I create powerful, emotional, unique sounds for games. With more than 6 years of experience in AAA and working with large clients like Nike, 
ProSoundEffects, Adidas, and Roblox, I have the ability to bring your project to the next level with sound.

I'm Ivan, an Italian Technical Sound Designer.

My work bridges sound design and technology, with skills spanning audio design, implementation,
custom plugin programming and workflow design. I love building audio systems that are both creative and functional, 
helping games sound as good as they feel to play.

When I’m not working on audio, I’m usually exploring the newest titles, playing
the bass, or traveling.
